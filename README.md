# angular-project

Need latest version of node.js - this helps the CLI package the application

A lot of problems are solved by making sure you're using the latest version of NodeJS, npm and the CLI itself.

## Updating NodeJS:

Go to nodejs.org and download the latest version - uninstall (all) installed versions on your machine first.

## Updating npm:

Run [sudo] npm install -g npm  (sudo  is only required on Mac/ Linux)

## Updating the CLI

[sudo] npm uninstall -g angular-cli @angular/cli (-g means its installed globally on your machine)

npm cache verify 

[sudo] npm install -g @angular/cli 

## create and open angular project

ng new angular-app (create project)

cd angular-app (go into the folder)

ng serve (brings up a development server which will run the app)
